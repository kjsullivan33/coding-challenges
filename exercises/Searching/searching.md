## Searching Algorithms

### What is a searching Algorithm
* Given an array, the simplest way to search for a value is to look at every
  element in the array and check if it's the value we want.

### Linear Search on Arrays
* Starting at the beginning of the array, check each value to see if it matches the 
  value you are looking for
* indexOf, includes, find, findIndex JS functions are linear search functions

### Binary Search on Sorted Arrays

### Naive String Searching Algorithm

### KMP String Searching Algorithm
