## Searching Algorithms

### What is a searching Algorithm
  * Given an array, the simplest way to search for a value is to look at every
    element in the array and check if it's the value we want.

### Linear Search on Arrays
  * Starting at the beginning of the array, check each value to see if it matches the 
    value you are looking for
  * indexOf, includes, find, findIndex JS functions are linear search functions

### Binary Search on Sorted Arrays
  * Much faster form of search
  * Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements
    at a time
  * Binary search only works on sorted arrays

### Naive String Searching Algorithm
  * When searching for substrings within a string
