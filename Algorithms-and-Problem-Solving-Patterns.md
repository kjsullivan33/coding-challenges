* An algorithm is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task

###Steps to take
1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns

## Problem Solving
  * Understand the problem
  * Explore Concrete Examples
  * Break it Down
  * Solve/Simplify
  * Look Back and Refactor

### Understand the Problem
  * Can I restate the problem in my own words?
  * What are the inputs that go into the problems?
  * What are the outputs that should come grom the solution to the problem?
  * Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to 
    solve the problem?)
  * How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### Explore Concrete Examples
  * Start with simple examples
  * Progress to more complex examples
  * Explore examples with empty inputs
  * Explore examples with invalid inputs

### Break It Down
  * Explicity write out the steps you need to take

### Solve/Simplify
  * Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
  * Temporarily ignore that difficulty 
  * Write a simplified solution
  * Then incorporate that difficulty back in

### Look Back and Refactor
  * Can you check the result?
  * Can you derive the result differently?
  * Can you understand it at a glance?
  * Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
  * Can you improve the performance of your solution?
  * Can you think of other ways to refactor?
  * How have other people solved this problem?

## Problem Solving Patterns
  * Frequency Counter
  * Multiple Pointers
  * Sliding Window
  * Divide and Conquer
  * Dynamic Programming
  * Greedy Algorithms
  * Backtracking
  * Etc...

### Frequency Counters
  * Uses objects or sets to collect values/ frequencies of values
  * This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations w/ arrays/strings
